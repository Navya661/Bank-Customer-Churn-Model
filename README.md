# Bank-Customer-Churn-Model
In this project, the aim is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a bank customer is likely to churn or not. Customer churn refers to the situation where a customer terminates their relationship with a business, and predicting it can help the bank take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.
